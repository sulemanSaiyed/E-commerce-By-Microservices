# E-Commerce Microservices Application

This project is a simple e-commerce application built using a microservices architecture. It leverages Spring Boot and Spring Cloud to provide a scalable and maintainable solution. The application consists of multiple services, each responsible for a specific domain, and is organized as a polyrepo.

## Architecture Overview

The application is composed of the following microservices:

1. **Config Server**: Centralized configuration management for all services.
2. **Eureka Server**: Service discovery for dynamic scaling and fault tolerance.
3. **API Gateway**: Entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate services.
4. **User Service**: Manages user registration, authentication, and profile management.
5. **Product Service**: Handles product catalog management, including product details and inventory.
6. **Order Service**: Manages order creation, processing, and tracking. (working)
7. **Rating and Review Service**: Allows users to rate and review products. (working)
